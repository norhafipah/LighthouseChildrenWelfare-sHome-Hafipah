<p style="background-color: Helvetica; font-size: 20px; text-align: justify; "> The Lighthouse Children's Welfare Home is a foster home registered with the Registrar of Societies since 2007.

​

The home is run by Mr and Mrs Steven, who have given up their respective jobs to become full-time foster parents to all the children. 

 

Mrs Steven, 64, is a trained Child education professional, specialised in pre-school children's education. She has worked 13 years with children in pre-schools before retiring to care full-time for her enlarged family. 

​

Mr Steven, 67, used to work in the banking and insurance sector, but quit is job many years ago to support the logistics of activities carried-out at the Lighthouse, and to be the best possible loving father for his children. He used to work as a school bus driver but following an injury due to a fall he no longer has income from this source to support the home. 


The seed for the couple’s lifelong dedication to caring for underprivileged children was planted when they took in abused children referred to them by others, who thought the child could find a loving and safe place among the Stevens and their biological children. Then another child came, and another one...it was difficult for them to see so much suffering and vulnerability without doing anything that could give the child a second chance in life. One child after another, the Lighthouse was born.

​

Lighthouse now has 63 children with ages ranging from 4 to 20.

 

Supported by a Committee of 14 persons, Lighthouse is run by 4 paid staff who take care of the children and 2 staff for security and maintenance. The home has expanded to 4 rented houses that comply with all regulations.

 

Over the last 15 years we have been able to count on the generosity of our community, our private and more recently a few corporate sponsors. However, with the growing number of children seeking protection every year, this adhoc and spontaneous support is not enough to ensure the sustainability of our services. We are planning for the longer term viability of Lighthouse and to continue to improve the quality of our care rather than having to fight for survival every month. </p>
